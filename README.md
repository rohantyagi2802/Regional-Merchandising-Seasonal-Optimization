Business Problem Statement: Regional Merchandising & Seasonal Optimization

A leading retail company is looking to move away from its "one-size-fits-all" inventory strategy. Currently, the company stocks similar items, colors, and sizes across all locations regardless of local trends or seasonal shifts. Management has noticed that high-margin categories (like Clothing and Footwear) often face heavy markdowns in certain states while selling out instantly in others.

To increase profitability, the company needs to transition to a localized inventory model. They want to identify which specific product attributes—such as Color, Size, and Category—align with the demographic profile (Age and Gender) and regional preferences of each Location during specific Seasons.

The Overarching Business Question:
"How can the company optimize its regional product assortment and seasonal stock levels to align with localized consumer preferences, thereby reducing unsold inventory and maximizing the total purchase amount per region?"
